# New Experiments for Revision

This directory contains the codes for the new experiments that were conducted as part of the revision process. Below is a summary of each experiment and instructions on how to run them.

## Hermes in PlainText

This experiment implements the Hermes algorithm in plaintext. To run the experiment, use the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Constrained-Path-Shortest-Computation

This experiment deals with constrained path shortest computation. You can run it with the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Path Traveling Salesman Problem (1.5-Approximation)

This experiment is based on the Path Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and uses a naive implementation of Zenklusen's 1.5-approximation algorithm. It is forked from [this repository](https://github.com/arvid220u/path-tsp-1.5-approximation). To run the test for this experiment, use the following command:

```bash
python3 test-path-tsp-approx.py
```
