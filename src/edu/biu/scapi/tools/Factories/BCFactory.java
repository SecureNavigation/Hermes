 * Suppose we wish to wrap a higher-level cryptographic element that uses a primitive interface in its inner implementation. 
 * For example, HMAC of BC holds a Digest interface but requires a specific digest to invoke its main functions. 
 * However, the users of our tool are not familiar with the classes of BC. Yet if we wish to wrap this class, 
 * we will need to instantiate a concrete Digest (specified by the user) to the wrapped BcHMAC. 
 * The aim of the BCFactory is to translate from an algorithm name string to an external library instance. 
 * For example, in BcHMAC the user passes a hash name that eventually will be translated to a digest. 
 * If the user passed the "SHA1" string, the translation tool generates the related SHA1 digest.
