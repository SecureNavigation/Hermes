/**
 * This class is an auxiliary class that allows to send the actual data of a TPElement using the Serialization mechanism.
 * This is NOT a TPElement, just the data to possibly create one if you hold the right TrapdoorPermutation. The creation of the TPElement will be performed by the TrapdoorPermutation
 * and will succeed only if the value is valid. The check will be performed by the permutation.
 * The getSendableData() function implemented by the different TPElements extracts the data from the element and puts it in a newly created object TPElementSendableData.
 * The corresponding TrapdoorPermuation can re-generate the serialized TPElement by calling the function generateElement(TPElementSendableData): TPElement.
