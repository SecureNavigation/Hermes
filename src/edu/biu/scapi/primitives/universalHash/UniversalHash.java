/** 
 * General interface for perfect universal hash. Every class in this family should implement this interface.
 * 
 * A universal hash function is a family of hash functions (as in the sense of hash functions for data structures) with the property that 
 * a randomly chosen hash function (from the family) yields very few collisions, with good probability. 
 * More importantly in a cryptographic context, universal hash functions have important properties, like good randomness extraction and 
 * pairwise independence. Many universal families are known (for hashing integers, vectors, strings), and their evaluation is often very efficient.
 * The notions of perfect universal hashing and collision resistance hash are distinct, and should not be confused (it is unfortunate that they 
 * have a similar name). We therefore completely separate the two implementations so that collision-resistant hash functions cannot be confused 
 * with perfect universal hash functions.
