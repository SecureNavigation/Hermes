/** 
 * This class implements some common functionality of varying input and output length prf classes.
 * 
 * PrfVaryingFromPrfVaryingInput is a pseudorandom function with varying input/output lengths, based on HMAC or any other implementation 
 * of PrfVaryingInputLength. We take the interpretation that there is essentially a different random function for every output length. 
 * This can be modeled by applying the random function to the input and the required output length (given as input to the oracle). 
 * The pseudorandom function must then be indistinguishable from this.
 * We use PrfVaryingInputLength for this construction because the input length can already be varying; this makes the construction more simple and efficient.
