 * This class is a simple holder for a pair of secret keys, one used for encryption and the other one for authentication.
 * Yet, it is also a type of AuthEncKey and for extension a type of Secret key. Therefore, it can be passed to the
 * init functions of classes implementing the SymmetricEnc interface. Since ScEncryptThenMac is a type of SymmetricEnc,
 * it needs a key of type SecretKey to be passed in its init functions, but also it has to make sure that two distinct
 * keys have been passed, one for encryption and one for authentication. This can be achieved using an instance of this class.
