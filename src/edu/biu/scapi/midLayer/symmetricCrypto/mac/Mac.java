 * General interface for Mac. Every class in this family must implement this interface. <p>

 * In cryptography, a message authentication code (often MAC) is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message.

 * A MAC algorithm, accepts as input a secret key and an arbitrary-length message to be authenticated, 
 * and outputs a tag. The tag value protects both a message's data integrity as well as its authenticity, by allowing verifiers 
 * (who also possess the secret key) to detect any changes to the message content.
