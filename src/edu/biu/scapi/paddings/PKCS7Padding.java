/**
 * Concrete padding class implements the PKCS7 padding algorithm:
 * the input shall be padded at the trailing end with k-(lth mod k) octets all having value k-(lth mod k), where lth is
 * the length of the input. In other words, the input is padded at the trailing end with one of the following strings:
 *                01 -- if lth mod k = k-1
 *                02 02 -- if lth mod k = k-2
 *                    .
 *                    .
 *                    .
 *		          k k ... k k -- if lth mod k = 0
 *
 * This padding method is well defined if and only if k is less than 256.
