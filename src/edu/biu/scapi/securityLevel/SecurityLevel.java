/**
 * Many cryptographic primitives and schemes have different security levels. 
 * For example, an encryption scheme can be CPA-secure (secure against chosen-plaintext attacks)
 * or CCA-secure (secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks). 
 * The security level of a cryptographic entity is specified by making the implementing class of the entity 
 * declare that it implements a certain security level; for example, an encryption scheme that is CCA-secure will implement the Cca interface. 
 * Different primitives have different families that define their security levels (e.g., hash functions, MACs, encryption). 
 * It is often the case that different security levels of a given primitive form a hierarchy (e.g., any CCA-secure encryption scheme is also CPA-secure), 
 * and in this case they extend each other. Thus, it suffices to implement a Cca interface and this immediately implies that a Cpa interface is also implied. 
 * <p>
 * All of the interfaces expressing a security level are marker interfaces that define types of security level and do not have any functionality.
