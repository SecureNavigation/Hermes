/**
 * This hierarchy specifies the security level of encryption schemes; it does not differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric encryption. 
 * There are two sub-hierarchies for encryption. The first relates to the adversarial power and includes Eav (eavesdropping adversary), CPA (chosen-plaintext attack), 
 * CCA1 (preprocessing chosen-ciphertext attack), and CCA2 (full chosen-ciphertext attack). The second relates to the aim of the attack and includes Indistinguishable (for the standard indistinguishability notion) and NonMalleable; 
 * note that non-malleability implies indistinguishability and thus the NonMalleable interface extends the Indistinguishable interface.
